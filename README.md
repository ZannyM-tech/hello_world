# hello_world
class repository for project
Hi, my name is Suzanne Monroe and I am completing a class project for my Script programming class.
I am learning how to navigate Github.  I wish I had the starter document in my other class!
The first time I ever used Github, I had no idea what I was doing.
I'm thankful that this starter document shows exactly what to do.
